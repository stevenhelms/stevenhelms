# Steve Helms

I am a life-long learner, problem-solver, and servant. My service to others has looked different over the years. 
There have been seasons of using my systems, programming, and cybersecurity skills to serve and protect organizations. 
My current focus is to benefit others directly through strategic technology oversight and management, teaching, and mentoring. 

I favor old-fashioned paper notes and can often be found playing disc golf, learning something new, or cooking. 
Preparing and sharing a meal with friends and family is a wonderful way to connect with others.

## What I know

I've been programming since 1988 so rather than list out the dozens of languages I've used, I currently use:

- Python - data engineering, backend calculations.

I'm not in this space often in my current role, but still get to contribute on occasion.
